I am currently a second-year Master of Public Health student at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/epidemiology). My research interests include emergency obstetric care, perinatal epidemiology, and other areas of maternal health. When I'm not thinking about the fragile state of healthcare systems I live for the New England Patriots and Michigan football! #GoBlue
